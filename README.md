license plate detection using MATLAB

This project aims to detect and recognize vehicle number plates using image processing techniques in MATLAB. 
The process involves several steps, including image preprocessing, noise reduction, morphological operations, edge detection, segmentation, and character extraction. The final goal is to accurately identify and display the vehicle's registration number from an image of its number plate.
